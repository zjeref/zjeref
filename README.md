### Hi there 👋

<!--
Hi there! I'm a MERN stack developer with a strong passion for JavaScript and automation. While I have a basic understanding of Java, Python, and machine learning, I find myself most drawn to the versatility of JavaScript and its many use cases.

In my free time, I love to experiment with building bots and automating tasks. My go-to frameworks for these projects are Puppeteer and Cheerio. As I continue to develop my skills, I'm excited to explore how these tools can be used to create more complex and sophisticated bots.

Currently, I'm focused on learning React and Node.js to build robust and dynamic web applications. I'm always eager to collaborate on open-source projects and contribute to the wider developer community.

Let's connect and see how we can learn from each other!
