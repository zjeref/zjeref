### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi there! I'm a MERN stack developer with a strong passion for JavaScript and automation. While I have a basic understanding of Java, Python, and machine learning, I find myself most drawn to the versatility of JavaScript and its many use cases.

In my free time, I love to experiment with building bots and automating tasks. My go-to frameworks for these projects are Puppeteer and Cheerio. As I continue to develop my skills, I'm excited to explore how these tools can be used to create more complex and sophisticated bots.

Currently, I'm focused on learning React and Node.js to build robust and dynamic web applications. I'm always eager to collaborate on open-source projects and contribute to the wider developer community.

Let's connect and see how we can learn from each other!


Here are some ideas to get you started:

-ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my skills in MERN stack development.
-ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about various MERN stack technologies such as MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js, as well as JavaScript and web development concepts.
-ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to web development using the MERN stack, particularly those that focus on building scalable and user-friendly web -applications.
-ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with finding resources to improve my understanding of MERN stack best practices and advanced topics such as authentication and security.
-ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to MERN stack development or web development in general, and I'll do my best to provide an informative answer!
